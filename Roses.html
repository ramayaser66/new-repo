            A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. 
            There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. 
            They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.

            Roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, 
             giving rise to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult to determine basic species.
             Fewer than 10 species,
             mostly native to Asia, were involved in the crossbreeding that ultimately produced todayâ€™s many types of garden roses.
