        When it comes to these classic yellow blooms, there's way more than meets the eye!

    <p>
        Each sunflower is actually thousands of teeny flowers.
        The iconic yellow petals and fuzzy brown centers are actually individual flowers themselves. 
        As many as 2,000 can make up the classic Sunflowes.
        You should harvest sunflowers in the morning, not the afternoon.

        Sunflowers are native to the Americas and were domesticated around 1000 B.C.
        people saw the value in growing sunflowers, which are still harvested for 
        sunflower seeds (and the oil you can make from them)  today.
         In 2014, 1.7 million acres were planted in the United States

        A dried sunflower makes a unique, natural bird feeder. Each sunflower can contain as many as 1,000 to 2,000 seeds.
        So there are tons for birdies to munch on!
